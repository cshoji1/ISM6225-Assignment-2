        <p>Hello! My name is Christina Shoji and I am very eager to share this this website I have designed to explore drama movies. I have a great interest in web development as well as data visualization. I have previously worked in analytics for 4 years in the accounting/finance sector.
         My experience building this interactive wesbite has been truly rewarding, seeing it all come together as well challenging to implement newly learned skills. For this web application, I have utilized programming languages such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
         I wanted to implement features that were both user friendly and effective. I researched movie box office data to gather some data and for the data visualization, I used Chart.js. This is a JavaScript library for creating data visualizations
         such as charts and graphs. I tested the website thoroughly to make sure all the features were working and made nescessary changes to improve the user expereince and interface. Please feel free to take a deeper look into this project and follow along on my web development journey on my GitHub account below.
